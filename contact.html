<h1>Welcome to my page.</h1>
<p>Hello, this website is mainly for learning purposes & to showcase some projects i've been working with.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
My name is Edvard, I'm 25 years old,
in august 2020 i started studying as a computer technician with a specialty in programming.
Since then I've really been dedicating myself to studying more about;
computers, hardware, GNU/Linux & programming.
<br>
Throughout my studies I've found the philosophy behind UNIX systems compelling.
Which also naturally made me appriciate principles from KISS & <a href="https://www.suckless.org">suckless</a>.
These principles has led me to learning C & POSIX compliant shell scripting in my own time.
It has also resulted in me running Gentoo Linux with my own custom kernel customized for my new Lenovo P14s
<a href="https://www.github.com/edvardxyz/kernel-config">kernel config</a>
Working with a Gentoo system has been a big time sink, but nonetheless its been a good project to learn about the ins & out of a GNU/Linux system.
The reason I decided on Gentoo as my desktop distrubution, is because portage(Gentoo's package manager)
allows me to compile each package with the specific USE flags that I need.
When running a binary Linux distrubution people have packaged the binary with whatever they find usefull(which means enabling as much as possible for compatibility).
If you looked at my <a href="https://www.github.com/edvardxyz/make.conf">make.conf</a> you would find that my global USE flags
disables gtk, systemd, qt, kde, gnome & many others. I can do that because I'm running DWM as my windows manager from <a href="https://www.suckless.org">suckless</a>
& when I need program to have a gui i enable the appropriate GUI USE flags.
You might ask why it's necessary to go trough the hassle of compiling & configuring each package.
I do it because it avoids dependencies, makes programs lighter & packages are compiled for my specific CPU for runtime performance.
This also makes the surface area of each program smaller avoiding bugs & security holes.

<h3>Education</h3>
The school I'm studying at is <a href="https://www.mercantec.dk">Mercantec</a>
& I also have a temporary internship with Mercantec until I find a internship somewhere else.
At school & the internship we mostly work with C# & PHP, where C# has become the language I'm most proficient in.

If you go to my <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> or github you will find some projects I've been working on.
