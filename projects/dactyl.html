<h2>Dactyl-Manuform</h2>
<p>
I tried finding the best possible keyboard online, and my conclusion was, that to achive this I would have to make my own.
Maybe a Kinesis can match a <a href="https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard">Dactyl-Manuform</a>, but it is very expensive and not as fun to just buy it :)<br>
I used Kailh Box Royal switches which are tactile not clickey, with actuation around 75g.
My keycaps are all DSA profile pbt plastic black, with no prints.
To print the keyboard and wrist rests, I used a Ender 3 Pro. I decided to use a 2 mm metal plate to close the bottom.
The plate increased the weight significantly which prevents the keyboard from moving and also gives a stable feeling.
