<h2>Libreboot</h2>
<p>

In the summer 2020 i found a guy who had 15 T500 and T400 thinkpads for sale on dba.dk.
So i decided to buy them all so I could libreboot them and maybe sell them for a small profit.
I would also keep one for myself to have a completely open source laptop. I had never done anything like this,
so I also had to buy a BeableBone Black and a Pomona 5250 SOIC16 clip.<br>
You can read more about how and why at <a href="https://www.libreboot.org">libreboot.org</a>
